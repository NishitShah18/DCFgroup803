        <h2>What is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol?</h2>
        <p>
            Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is based on client-server protocol which provides an Internet
            Protocol (IP)
            address automatically to the devices which want to make connection with a server. Thus, Dynamic Host
            Configuration
            Protocol (DHCP) is an application layer protocol which is used to provide:

            <b>1.</b> Subnet Mask<br>
            <b>2.</b> Router Address<br>
            <b>3.</b> DNS Address<br>
            <b>4.</b> Vendor Class Identifier<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            According to RFCs 2131 and 2132, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defines DHCP as a standard built
            on the
            Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP), a protocol that DHCP shares many implementation specifics with. A DHCP server
            can provide
            host devices with the necessary TCP/IP setup data. Windows 2016 server also includes DHCP server which is an
            optional
            network server and can be used to lease IP addresses and other information to establish successful
            connection. DHCP is
            also based on discovery, offer, request, and ACK.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the above diagram, We can notice that DHCP server takes help of IP address database to generate a range
            on IP
            addresses and then assigns those addresses to the hosts with help of IP router.
            DHCP port numbers are 67 for the server and 68 for the client. It employs UDP services and is a
            client-server protocol.
            A pool of addresses is used to assign IP addresses. The DHCP connection process, also known as the DORA
            process,
            involves the client and server exchanging 8 DHCP messages, though mostly 4 DHCP messages.

        <h2>Advantages of using DHCP:</h2>

        <p>
            <b>a.</b> It offers centralized management of IP addresses.</br></br>
            <b>b.</b> New host devices can easily added to the connection while the computers which are no longer
            connected can
            be removed
            from server connection.</br></br>
            <b>c.</b> Without having to reconfigure every client, DHCP server's IP address space may be easily
            changed.</br></br>
            <b>d.</b> Automatic management of IP addresses, including the prevention of duplicate IP address
            problems.</br></br>
            <b>e.</b> Allows support for BOOTP clients, so you can easily transition your networks from BOOTP to
            DHCP.</br></br>
            <b>f.</b> Allows the administrator to set lease times, even on manually allocated IP addresses.</br></br>
            <b>g.</b> Allows limiting which MAC addresses are served with dynamic IP addresses.</br></br>
            <b>h.</b> Allows the administrator to configure additional DHCP option types, over and above what is
            possible
            with
            BOOTP.</br></br>
            <b>i.</b> Allows the definition of the pool or pools of IP addresses that can be allocated dynamically. A
            user might
            have a server
            that forces the pool to be a whole subnet or network. The server should not force such a pool to consist of
            contiguous
            IP addresses.</br></br>
            <b>j.</b> Allows the association of two or more dynamic IP address pools on separate IP networks (or
            subnets). This is
            the basic
            support for secondary networks. It allows a router to act as a BOOTP relay for an interface which has more
            than one IP
            network or subnet IP address.</br></br>

            <b>1. DHCP discover message:</b><br><br>
            This is the initial message produced throughout the server and client's communication process. To find out
            whether a
            network has any DHCP servers or servers at all, the client host generates this message. To locate the DHCP
            server, this
            message is broadcast to all connected devices in the network. The size of this message is 342 or 576 bytes.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/Picture3.png" class="images" style="float: right; ">
        <p>
            <b>2. DHCP offer message:</b><br><br>

            The unleased IP address and other TCP configuration details will be supplied by the server in its response
            to host in
            this message. The server is broadcasting this message. The message is 342 bytes in size. The client host
            will take the
            first DHCP OFFER message it gets if there are many DHCP servers available in the network. In order to
            identify the
            server, a server ID is also supplied in the packet.
        </p>
        <img src="./media/Picture4.png" class="images" style="float: left; ">
        <p>
            <b>3. DHCP request message:</b><br><br>

            A client will broadcast a DHCP request message in response to an offer message it has received. The client
            will do a
            free ARP to see whether any other hosts with the same IP address are already present on the network. If no
            other host
            responds, there are no hosts in the network with the identical TCP configuration, and the message is sent to
            the server
            to indicate that the IP address has been accepted. This message also includes a Client ID.

            In conclusion, DHCP is a protocol that allows mobile hosts, such as notebook PCs, to access network
            resources. Security is not taken
            into account in the present DHCP protocol. Each client can utilise the network if the client configures
            network
            resources such as IP address. Furthermore, contemporary DHCP servers assign network resources to any client
            who makes a
            request. To address these issues, the IETF has suggested an authentication technique for the DHCP message,
            which is also
            available as an Internet Draft. However, this solution simply authenticates DHCP messages between the server
            and
            clients, and therefore ignores the necessity for client-level access control. On the basis of this
            technique, DAG has
            been constructed and assessed as an access control gateway. Only authorised clients received network
            resources from an
            authenticated DHCP server. DAG's access control is based on the DHCP ACK message's allotted information for
            a client.
